# Self-Evaluation

- This final CFU encompassed everything you've learned in Mod 0, and maybe even required some learning outside of what you've explicitly been taught. How did it feel as you faced these challenges? It was actually not as bad as I thought it would be. After reading through the lesson, and going through the pairing secession 3, I thought it was going to be pretty rough...but just being given stipulations and told to run with it, it was actually kind of nice to see everything we've worked with to this point comes together AND works together.
- How is your workflow going, in terms of taking breaks, staying focused, etc.? Workflow has been going better than I imagined it would at first. The work space is conducive to studying and focus. Implementing breaks has helpped with preventing unproductive struggle, but blocking time off for individual assignments or tasks, and sticking to that time slot, is still a work in progress. I've found myself referring back to my time management guidelines I set for myself more frequently than I have before in any kind of student-mindset. 
- What did you learn from this exercise that you want to remember as you begin Mod 1? To not question myself whether a particular method is relevent to use to complete the task. I have to remind myself, everything works together. Find a way to complete the task, and don't question whether or not you 'can,' but if you 'should' in order to make it work.
